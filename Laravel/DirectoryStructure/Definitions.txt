DIRECTORY STRUCTURE IN LARAVEL:
===============================

1.  App Directory:- Contains the core code that runs the laravel application. Most classes are stored 
    in this directory and its sub-directories.

2.  Bootstrap Directory:- Includes the code that collates all files spread throughout the directories
    and boot/run the application.

3.  Config Directory:- Includes files related to configuration of different components.

4.  Database Directory:- Contains database migrations, seeds, model factories and the SQLite database
    that will be used in subsequent sessions.

5.  Public Directory:- Includes files that must be exposed to the internet. Thus the index.php file
    calls the app.php file in the bootstrap directory to start the application whenever it recieves
    a request. All HTML, CSS and Image files are also stored in this directory.    

6.  Resources Directory:- Include the views that will be used to display the final web page as well as
    the un-complied assets related to Javascript and CSS.

7.  Routes Directory:- Provides the route/path definition for the application that will match the request
    with its response.

8.  Storage Directory:- Includes data generated by the Laravel framework itself for storage and cache.

9.  Tests Directory:-  Contains the test specification code for automated testing.

10. Vendor Directory:- Contains information on third party dependencies imported by the composer dependency
    manager.
