========================
INTRODUCTION TO LARAVEL:
========================

=> Laravel is a PHP based web framework for building high-end web applications using its significant
and graceful syntaxes.


=> It comes with a robust collection of tools and provides application architechture.


=> Moreover, it includes various characteristics of technologies like ASP.NET, CodeIgniter, Ruby on Rails
and alot more.


=> It facilitates developers by saving huge time and helps reduce thinking and planning to develop the entire
website from scratch.


=> Open source PHP framework.


=> Uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.


=> Laravel is an alternative to Cake Php & CodeIgniter.


=> Taylor Otwell developed Laravel in July 2011 and it was released more than five years after the release
of the CodeIgniter.



~ Some essential features provided by Laravel are:

* Routing Controllers

* Configuration Management (Can be done by Laravel automatically).

* Testability (You can test applications in different scenarios).

* Authentication & Authorization of users (Website and its panel can be access by selective audience).

* Modularity (Separation of tasks into tiny Modules. eg: Database work, Business Logic work, UI Desining work can be splitted into 3different modules).

* ORM = Object Relational Mapper (Just like entity framework in ASP.NET which auto-generates model classes according to our database tables).

* Provides Template Engine (In Laravel, Template engine name is Blade).

* Building Schemas.

* E-mail facilities.


=============================
PURPOSE OF LARAVEL FRAMEWORK:
=============================

=> Provide Abstraction (Hides irrelevant things).


=> Handles repetitive and menial task.


=> Arrange things in a logical structure. 


=> Reuses and assembles existing components, dependencies and libraries.


=> To build web applications in a structural manner.


=> Convention Over configuration.


=> Artisan Command For Automation.


=> Helper Functions (Global Php Functions).


=> Extensive Library.


Note: Your model class name will be set as plural in mapping procedure.

For example: Table name is Student, Model class name is Students.

Mapping is the process in which you create model classes according to your database tables and columns.



==============================
CONVENTION OVER CONFIGURATION:
==============================

i)    Can predict the dependencies of your application.

ii)   Automate the configuration related tasks.

iii)  Reduces the time & effort required to set up and configure services.

iv)   Suitable for Rapid Application Development (RAD).



===============================
ARTISAN COMMAND FOR AUTOMATION:
===============================

i)    Artisan is the name of the Command-Line-Interface (CLI) included in Laravel.

ii)   It provides a maximum number of helpful commands for your use while developing an application.

iii)  It is driven by the powerful symfony console component.

iV)   It is basically an Automation tool provided by Laravel.

v)    Used to create models, views and controllers by typing commands.

vi)   Used to create dummy server.

vii)  You can also perform database operations by using Artisan commands.


Note: To view a list of all available Artisan commands, you may use the list command: php artisan list.



========================================
HELPER FUNCTIONS (GLOBAL PHP FUNCTIONS):
========================================

i)    Helper functions reduces time & effort.

ii)   Helper functions are classified as follows:

* Arrays & objects

* Paths

* Strings

* URLs

* Miscellaneous 



====================
EXTENSIVE LIBRARIES:
====================

i)    Includes alot of popular and commonly used libraries.

ii)   Reduces time & effort.

iii)  Code snippet that allows inclusion of external libraries by using the composer package manager.

Note: You can download/Use the external libraries with the help of composer.

iv)   Command for using External Libraries: Composer require <Library-name>.
