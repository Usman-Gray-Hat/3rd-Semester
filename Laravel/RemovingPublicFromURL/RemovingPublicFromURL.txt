REMOVING PUBLIC FROM URL:
=========================

Step.1 Open vs code - right click on your project - click on Reveal in File Explorer.
       Project Reveal in File Explorer short cut key = "Shift+Alt+R".

Step.2 Double click on your project folder - open public folder - copy .htaccess file
       - get back to your project folder - paste .htaccess file.

Step.3 In your project folder, there is a PHP file named as "server" - copy server file
       - paste it in the same project folder.

Step.4 The file name will be shown as "server - Copy". Rename it from "server - Copy" to "index".


===============
IMPORTANT NOTE:
===============

       Now, when you run your application, it will directly redirect you to your welcome page instead
       of showing directories. But there is a security issue will be occured after removing public
       from URL. Your ".env" file (Database File) is now visible to everyone. To avoid this you need 
       to hide your .env file. 
       

======================
HIDING .env FILE CODE:
======================

       #Hides a specific file
       <Files .env> 
       Order allow,deny
       Deny from all
       </Files>


Note:  Open vs code - in your project folder - open htaccess and paste all the above code before the
       closing tag of IfModule to hide your ".env" file. Save it (Ctrl+s).

EXAMPLE:
========

       <IfModule>

       #Hides a specific file
       <Files .env> 
       Order allow,deny
       Deny from all
       </Files>

       </IfModule>
